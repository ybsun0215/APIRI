- function similarity: two API entities have similar usage.
- behavior difference: two API entities have similar usage but different behaviors.
- function replace: one API entity can be replaced by another API entity in some specific condition.
- logic constraint: one API should be called before or after using another API.
- efficiency comparison: two API entity have efficiency comparison in some specific conditions.
- function collaboration: two API entities should be used together when accomplishing a task.
- type conversion: two API entities can be converted to each other.
- unknow: two API entities do not contain the above relations.
